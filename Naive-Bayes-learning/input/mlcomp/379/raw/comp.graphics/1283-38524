Subject: Another CVIEW question (was CView answers)


	Has anybody gotten CVIEW to work in 32k or 64k color mode on a Trident
8900c hi-color card? At best the colors come out screwed up, and at worst the 
program hangs. I loaded the VESA driver, and the same thing happens on 2 
different machines.

	If it doesn't work on the Trident, does anybody know of a viewer that 
does?

Thanx!
