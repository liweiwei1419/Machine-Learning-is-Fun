Subject: Need specs/info on Apple QuickTime

I need to get the specs, or at least a very verbose interpretation of the
specs, for QuickTime.  Technical articles from magazines and references to
books would be nice too.

I also need the specs in a format usable on a Unix or MS-DOS system.  I can't
do much with the QuickTime stuff they have on ftp.apple.com in its present
format.

Thanks in advance.
