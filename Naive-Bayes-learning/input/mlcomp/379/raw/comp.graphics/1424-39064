Subject: Where can I find someone who can digitize Currier & Ives????


Does anyone know if any of Currier and Ives etchings have been digitized for 
use in desktop publishing?  I am particularly interested in their riverboat
scenes.  Does anyone know who can get me (for a fee) a good, digitized river-
boat image?

Thank you,

David Dumas
