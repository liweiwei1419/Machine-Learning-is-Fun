Subject: Siggraph 1987 Course Notes

I am looking for a copy of the following Siggraph publication: Gomez, J.E.
"Comments on Event Driven Annimation," Siggraph Course Notes, 10, 1987.

If anyone knows of a location where I can obtain a copy of these notes, I
would appreciate if they could let me know.  Thanks.
