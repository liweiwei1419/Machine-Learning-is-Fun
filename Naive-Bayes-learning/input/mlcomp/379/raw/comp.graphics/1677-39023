Subject: GIF TO TARGA
From: david.mason@channel1.com (David Mason)

Krzysztof Muchorowski was asking about GIF-to-TGA conversion so that he
could use DTA 1.5 to convert the TGA files to FLI animation files.

Krzysztof, update your copy of DTA to a more recent release (the current
is 1.8g).  Later versions of DTA can read GIF files.
