Subject: InterViews graphics package


Hello,

I'm trying out the C++ graphics package InterViews. Besides the man pages
on the classes, I haven't got any documentation. Is there anything else
around? Furthermore, can anyone send me a (small!) example program
which shows how to use these classes together ? I would be very gratefull...
