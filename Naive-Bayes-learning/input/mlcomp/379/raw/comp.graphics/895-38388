Subject: Fast polygon routine needed

This may be a fairly routine request on here, but I'm looking for a fast
polygon routine to be used in a 3D game.  I have one that works right now, but
its very slow.  Could anyone point me to one, pref in ASM that is fairly well
documented and flexible?
	Thanx,
