Subject: Photoshop for Windows



I am looking for comments from people who have used/heard about PhotoShop
for Windows. Is it good? How does it compare to the Mac version? Is there
a lot of bugs (I heard the Windows version needs "fine-tuning)?

Any comments would be greatly appreciated..

Thank you.
