Subject: What does the .bmp format mean?

What exactly does the windows bitmap format look like? I mean, how is
the data stored: width, height, no. of colours, bitmap data? I couldn't
find anything in ths user manual, is there any other reference material
which would give me this information?

Thanks,
Andrew
