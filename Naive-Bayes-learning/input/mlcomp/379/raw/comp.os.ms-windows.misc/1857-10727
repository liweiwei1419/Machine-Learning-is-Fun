This is the part that usually gets me. While I am set to make money, there usually
are OTHER things to be considered and debated. That is the purpose of life.
If you only willing to look at the stock price and sales numbers for gratification,
usually you'll end up with Japanese (or whoever that is competitive) owing your
business - i.e. short-sighted. IMO, this is very irresponsible, narrow minded and
selfish. Henceforth, ignoring the attack is not the right approach. As a matter of
fact, I just happen to believe the willingness to debate and readjust is the
greatest assets of this society. Sales number and stock price is the short-term
result, not the cause.
