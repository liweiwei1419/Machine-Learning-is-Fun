Subject: Hard drive compression ie, stacker.superstor etc.


I was wondering if any one knew how the various hard drive compression utilities work.  My hard
drive is getting full and I don't want to have to buy a new one.  What I'm intrested in is speed
,ease of use, amount of compression, and any other aspect you think might be important as I've never
use one of these things before. thanks  Morgan Bullard mb4008@coewl.cen.uiuc.edu
