Subject: I hate to make a decision !


Hi.
 
    Well, I really hate to make a decision, but recently, I have to choose
    whether stacker 3.0 or dos 6.0 with double space for my poor HD.
    I am using windwos 3.1 and I hope what I choose will live with windows.

    Any help will be appreciated.
