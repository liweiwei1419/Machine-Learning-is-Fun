Subject: Windows and ATI Ultra (mach8 chip)sizing question



I have just upgraded from a Trident TVGA9000 to an ATI Graphics Ultra (the
old mach8 chip).  I am quite pleased with the performance so far, but have
one problem.  When using windows in 800x600, I have noticed that the 
tile bars and scroll bars are significantly larger than they were when I
was using the Trident card.  Is there a setting in my .ini files that I can
change to make these smaller ?  I could not find the FAQ for this list...
