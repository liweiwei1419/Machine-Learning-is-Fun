Subject: LaserJet IV upgrades to 1200dpi opinions



What are the current products available to upgrade the resolution?
Which ones support postscript?

Any experiences with them, either good or bad?

Is the quality difference really noticable?

I'm planning on producing camera ready copy of homes.  Will the higher
resolution be noticed for these?
