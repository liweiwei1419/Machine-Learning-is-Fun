Subject: Has anyone heard of Syntrex


A friend recently bought a used 286.  The brand is Syntrex.  It didn't come with any documentation and I am trying to find some information about the computer.  So the question is, has anyone heard of it?  If you know anything about these please drop me a note.

Thank you
