Subject: Re: Gateway Monitor Problem--Again! Help


I believe I have the same monitor problem.  I have a system from Micron 
Computers with the 15" Mag 1564 (the same monitor as the gateway) and am having
the same symptoms.

What's this with removing the monitor extension cable?


				Thanks for any info.
