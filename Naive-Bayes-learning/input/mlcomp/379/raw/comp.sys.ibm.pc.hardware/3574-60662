Subject: Sending a Null character across Ethernet

I have a question regarding sending a NULL character across ethernet
connection. The actual problem is that emacs (Unix editior) needs
the NULL character for setting a mark and unfortunately we don't know
how to sent that from IBM PCs across ethernet. I am wondering if anyboy
knows the keyboard combination for sending the NULL character. 
BTW control,shift 2 which Ctrl @ does not work.

Thanks

Saeid
