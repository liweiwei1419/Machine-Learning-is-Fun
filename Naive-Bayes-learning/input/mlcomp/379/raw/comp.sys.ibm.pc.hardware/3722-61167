Subject: ET4000/W32 3dbench

Due to the large amount of request for 3dbench of ET4000/W32,
I finally can get a 3dbench v1.0 from a ftp site.

The 3dbench of ET4000/W32 in my Cardex W32 card with 1MB DRAM
has superscape benchmark of 26.3 frames/sec.

Hope it will satisfy people curiosity of this ET4000/W32 performance.
What other benchmark program result you would want to know? 8-)
