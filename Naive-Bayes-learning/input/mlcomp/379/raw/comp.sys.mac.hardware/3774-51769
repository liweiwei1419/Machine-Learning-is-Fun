Subject: Any Nanao 750i compatible Mac video cards?

Does anyone know if a Nanao 750i is compatible with any
popular Mac video cards? I have an oppurtunity to get a brand
new one, cheap, and I am very tempted, but it will be a waste
of time if I can't drive it using a standard video card.

While I'm on the subject, what's everybody's reccomendations for
a 21" color monitor. I've heard good things about the NEC 6FG, and
of course, there is always the reliable old Macintosh 21" display,
but what are YOUR experiences.
