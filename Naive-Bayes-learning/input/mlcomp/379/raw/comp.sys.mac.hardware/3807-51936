Subject: Good Hard-Disk driver for non-Apple drives? (Sys 7.1 compat.)


Hi there!

What is your recommendation for a good hard-disk driver software for
non-Apple drives? I would mainly need it for a SyQuest removable media
drive, but maybe for some normal drives too.
I have heard and seen good things about SilverLining, but don't know
any competitors. It does not need to be fancy, filled with features...
I more like it affordable.

Thanks
