Subject: Re: Centris 610 clock adjustment?

The article was probably referring to changing the clock oscillator in a manner similar to that done on Quadra 700's and IIsi's. I haven't read a report of this actually being done on a Centris 610 but supposedly this also works on Q900,
Q950 and centris 650 machines.
