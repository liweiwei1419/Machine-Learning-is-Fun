Subject: File Sharing Magneto Opticals?

Hi!

My co-worker has just attached a magneto-optical drive to his mac.
Works Great for him.  However, he tried to turn on file sharing, but it
wouldn't work.  Had some message about "Not all volumes are shareable"
???

So - has anyone had success in sharing MOs?  If so, please tell me how!
