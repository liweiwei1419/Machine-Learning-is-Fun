Subject: Powerbook with a math coprocessor?


I really want to buy a powerbook and would like one that can run 
Mathematica. So I need a coprocessor but I can not afford a PB180.
(who can?)  Is it possible to put a MCP in a PB160? The guy at the  
bookstore says no but I didn't think he had too much of a clue.

Please respond by e-mail:  ross@sbphy.physics.ucsb.edu

thanks in advance, richard
