Subject: MacWatch

Has anybody heard about a thing called a MacWatch? I saw it on TV a
couple of years ago, it is a watch with a reviever and a transmitter for
your mac. The practical upshot is that your Mac can page your watch and
display a small message. My flatmate is off to the states for a week or
two soon and I am interested in getting one. Any info would be
appreciated.

Thanx in advance.
Glenn.
