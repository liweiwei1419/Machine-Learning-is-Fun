Subject: Video cable options

	There was a discussion a couple of weeks ago about using different
cables to 
achieve different resolutions on the Quadra and Centris series.  A
company that sold the cables was mentioned.  Can someone please e-mail me
the companies name, address, etc, and any other info that may be relevant?
