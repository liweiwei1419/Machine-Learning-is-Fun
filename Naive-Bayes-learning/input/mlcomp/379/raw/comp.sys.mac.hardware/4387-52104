Subject: Supercard 1.6 & CDROM

I need help finding XCMDs to control a CD-ROM drive
from Aldus Supercard 1.6.  The Apple Hypercard CD-ROM
Toolkit does not work. Aldus has no clue. Apple has no clue.
Berkeley MUG and Boston MUG won't return any phone calls.
My local user group has no idea. HELP!
Commercial or shareware is fine...
Please reply by email: clee@theporch.raider.net
THANKS!
