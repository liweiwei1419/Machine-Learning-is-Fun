Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they get
with the cards. I have only one report, which seems to indicate that
a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! Access to memory takes
LONGER when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card
of 32K may be worth $0. I don't know what kind of numbers 64K cards get
you. Also I found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards
via software(read about it in the Mac IIsi tech notes from ftp.apple.com)

So is $99 a good deal or not, I still don't know.
