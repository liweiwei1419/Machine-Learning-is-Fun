Subject: Apple RGB Monitor vs Apple 12" Color Monitor

I have an old Apple RGB Monitor for a IIGS which
looks a whole lot like the 12" Monitor.  I have the
sneaking suspicion that if I had the right cable I
could use it on my Mac.

Does anyone know if my suspicions are correct or
am I just full of it.
