Subject: Need X Win PopUp Menu package


Rather than write my own, can anyone direct me to a package that will let me create
cascaded popup menus in X windows.  For reasons of portability, the package should 
not rely on any X toolkit other than XLib and the XT Intrinsics.  Something written
in C++ would be nice, too.

Thanks
