Subject: Problem with German keyboard on a Sparc10

Yesterday I changed the US-Keyboard of my Sparc10 with a german keyboard.
And now I cannot get any "Alt Graph" characters ('tilde' usw.).
When I exit from X I can get the characters, but not under X.

Can anybody give me some hints, where to check for the correct installation
of the keyboard.
