Subject: Multiple(Not Simultaneous) server connections

Hi,

   We have a requirement for dynamically closing and opening
different display servers within an X application in a manner such
that at any time there is only one display associated with the client.

   Assumming a proper cleanup is done during the transition should
we anticipate any problems.
