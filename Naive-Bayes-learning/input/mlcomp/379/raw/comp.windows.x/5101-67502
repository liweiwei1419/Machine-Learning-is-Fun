Subject: Encyclopedia/Directory of Widgets?

  Is there such a document either in the Bookstores or possible
on an ftp site somewhere?  Nothing really fancy, just something
that gives a listing of the available widgets, and the resources
that are pertinant to them, and what flavors of Motif they
occur in.
