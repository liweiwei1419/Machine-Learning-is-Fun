Subject: xv -root with vue? (was Re: xloadimage -onroot ...)

On a related note, how can I use xv to display colored GIFs on my
root display with HP Vue?

All I can do with Vue is display xbm's through their
Backdrop Style Manager.

xv does not seem to be able to override whatever Vue
puts there.

Thanks, Jan
