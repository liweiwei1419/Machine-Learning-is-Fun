Subject: Re: Squaw lift tickets available for $32 each

Tickets midweek are now down to $34.  They will be $25 starting last
week in April, or maybe first week in May.  By the way, the current
conditions (was there Apr 12-13) are great for spring skiing, with
excellent coverage, most stuff open, and no lift lines.
