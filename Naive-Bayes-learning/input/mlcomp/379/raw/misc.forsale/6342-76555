Subject: Mac Modem Wanted

I would like to buy a cheap modem for my Mac. Did I mention that I would
prefer it to be cheap?  2400 baud preferred, but when you're looking for
cheap (and I do mean cheap) beggars can't be choosers.  E-mail me.

Oh, I'm in Seattle, so if you were also, that would be a bonus.
