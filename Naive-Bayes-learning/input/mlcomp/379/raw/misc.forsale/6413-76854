Subject: JOHN M. BELL: Any luck catching him yet?

I was one of the unfortunate people to run into this guy.  I sent him
$30 cash (Stupid, I know) for 4 CDs.  That was the last I heard of him.

I know there were some other people ripped off by this guy.  Has there been
any advances in tracking him down?
