Subject: Hockey on TV in the Bay area, NOT!

Hi all,

I don't get the sport's channel and I'm desparate for some playoff action
(especially the Cannucks).  Does anyone know of a sports bar on the Bay
Peninsula that will be showing hockey games.  I'm looking for something 
between redwood City and Mountain View.

Thanks a lot,
Greg
