Yes, Yes, I can see it now >>>> all those Sabre fans FINALLY taking
their Sabre sweaters out of the moth balls and proudly wearing them.
After 9 years of playoff frustration and being up 3 games to nil
I guess it is a pretty good bet.    BUT there has not been a team
that has come back from an 0-3 deficit since 1975 - could this be
the year.   (Don't throw out the moth balls yet)
