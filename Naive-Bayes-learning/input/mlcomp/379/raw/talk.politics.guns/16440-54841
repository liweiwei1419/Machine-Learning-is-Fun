Subject: AP rifles?

I just read a clari article about how, among the other weapons
the BD had purched, they had two "Barrett 50-caliber armor-piercing
rifles."  How the hell do you use an armor-piercing rifle?  Run
up to a tank and try to stab it?

Once again, ignorance prevails amongst the media . . .
