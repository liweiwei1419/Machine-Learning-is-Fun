dear pete,

for one who is so zionist as you, you should at least know your
hebrew, young man.

The last sentence in your posting should read:

Medina achat leshnai amim (not Echad medionnot leshtai amim).

I don't want to address your comments. They speak for themselves.

best regards from a Palestinian of Jewish origin who talks, reads and writes
Hebrew and does not hate Jews nor anybody else.
