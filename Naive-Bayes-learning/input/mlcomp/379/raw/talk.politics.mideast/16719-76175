   The comparison of the Palestinian situation with the Holocaust
is insulting and completely false.  Any person making such a rude
and false comparison is either ignorant of the Holocaust, or also
ignorant of the situation in the mideast, or is an anti-semite.

   To compare a complicated political situation with the genocide
of 6,000,000 Jews is racist in and of itself.
