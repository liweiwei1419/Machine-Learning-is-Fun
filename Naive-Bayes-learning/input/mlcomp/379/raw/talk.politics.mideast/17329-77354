In September 1990, our medical reserve unit was sent to the KETZIOT
prison camp to take care of Arab prisoner who were housed in 5
sections of 1500 prisoners each, with each section subdivided in
5 units housing 300 prisoners. The prisoners would "communicate"
with other distant sections (sometimes 50-100 yards away) by
taking stones, tying written notes to the stones, and throwing
them with incredible precision to other sections. I should have
been a recruiter for the Red Sox :-) There were at least three
prisoners who could have been outstanding pitchers.
