Subject: Source to create FLI or FLC ?


Does anyone know if the source is available to create FLI
or FLC animations? I would ideally like DLL's for Windows
but would settle for C source.  I've heard they might be 
available on Amiga forums somewhere.  The libraries
currently distributed by Autodesk, AAWIN, AAPLAY, do NOT
have FLI creation capability, only playback.

Any pointers would be appreciated, thanks!
