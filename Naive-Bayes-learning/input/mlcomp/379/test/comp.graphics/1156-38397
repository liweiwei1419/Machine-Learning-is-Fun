Subject: Video in/out


I'm getting ready to buy a multimedia workstation and would like a little
advice.  I need a graphics card that will do video in and out under windows.
I was originally thinking of a Targa+ but that doesn't work under Windows.
What cards should I be looking into?

Thanks,
Craig
