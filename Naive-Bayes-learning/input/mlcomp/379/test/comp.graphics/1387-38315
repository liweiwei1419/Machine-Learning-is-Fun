Subject: windows imagine??!!


Has ANYONE who has ordered the new PC version of Imagine ACTUALLY recieved
it yet?   I'm just about ready to order but reading posts about people still
awaiting delivery are making me a little paranoid.  Has anyone actually 
held this piece of software in their own hands?

Later,
