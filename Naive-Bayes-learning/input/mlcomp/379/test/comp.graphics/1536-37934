Actually I am trying to write something like this but I encounter some
problems, amongst them:

- drawing a 3d wireframe view of a quadric/quartic requires that you have
the explicit equation of the quadric/quartic (x, y, z functions of some
parameters). How to convert the implicit equation used by PoV to an
explicit one? Is it mathematically always possible?

I don't have enough math to find out by myself, has anybody heard about
useful books on the subject?
