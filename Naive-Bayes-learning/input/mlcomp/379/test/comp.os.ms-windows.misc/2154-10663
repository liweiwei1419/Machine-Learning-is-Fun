Subject: Hot-key for Screen Saver?


Is there a hot-key for the Windows 3.1 screen saver utility?  If not, is
there an easy way to create one?  The reason that I need one is that my
dad's company is anal retentive about leaving a computer while the
information can be accessed so the employees are not allowed to walk away
from the computer until the screen saver kicks in (as if that is terribly
secure).  Also, the system manager won't let any software be added so 
another program such as LOCK32.ZIP from cica or a different screen saver
is out.

Thanks for any and all help.
