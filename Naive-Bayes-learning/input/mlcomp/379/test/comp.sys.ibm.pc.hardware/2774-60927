Subject: DRDOS vs. MSDOS 6.0


I'm using DRDOS 6.0 with SuperStor for nearly 2 years now, and I'm wondering, if
MSDOS 6.0 could keep up with it at last. Is there anybody who tried out both? 
What about this Double-Disk ? (had lots of problems with SStor too.)
How much memory do you get? (I've got 616K with EMM and SStor)
What about the on-line help (Really great in DRDOS)
Any help appreciated.
