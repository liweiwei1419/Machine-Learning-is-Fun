Subject: Request For Input: MultiSpin CD-ROM Drives


I'm looking into getting an external, reasonably fast (<350 ms avg access time)
Multispin CD-ROM drive that supports "Photo CD Multi Session", has audio
output, and SCSI interface for connection to the PAS16 SCSI port. Does anyone
have any comments/experiences/warnings/recommendations they'd like to share
concerning the Texel DM-5024 and/or Toshiba TXM-3401E and/or others. THANKS!
