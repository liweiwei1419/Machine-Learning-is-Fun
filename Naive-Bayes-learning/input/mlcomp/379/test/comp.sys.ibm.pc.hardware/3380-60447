Subject: AT's need what kinda battery???
From: grisch@uceng.uc.edu (George Risch)

Hello,

	I'm the proud owner of an IBM AT without a battery. I know it
hooks into jumper J21, but I need more info so I can replace it. What's
its voltage? Any suggestions for replacement? Where can I get one? Please
