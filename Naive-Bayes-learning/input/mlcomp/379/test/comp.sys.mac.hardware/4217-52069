  So I finally decided to risk this upgrade, FAQ in hand I've gathered the
pieces together.  The only problem is that I haven't been able to find
anyone who's even heard of thermal tape/glue (which is what the FAQ
recommends for attaching the heat sink)  I am just tempted to use duct
tape here.... anyone hae any ideas for me for attaching the heat sink to
the processor??  much thanks.
