Subject: Solution: Why do I need "xrdb -m" when .Xdefaults unchanged?

The short answer seems to be: "I don't".
The particular package (wscrawl) seems to reset *all* its defaults
if *any* of them are missing from the .Xdefaults file.  Once I added
the missing ones to the .Xdefaults file, the problem goes away.
