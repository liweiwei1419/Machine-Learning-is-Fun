: VirtualGrabKeys is not an OW resource. It belongs to olvwm(1).

Not only that, the olvwm(1) (version3.3) man-page says it's called

     GrabVirtualKeys " (Boolean)"
          This resource controls whether the keys below marked as
          involving  grabs  will  be  active  or  not.   If  this
          resource is set to False, then  none  of  the  bindings
          marked  below  with  an  asterisk  will ever be active.
          Default value:  True
