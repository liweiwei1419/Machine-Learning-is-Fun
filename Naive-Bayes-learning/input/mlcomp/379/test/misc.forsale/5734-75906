Subject: Mac monitor **WANTED**


Wanted:  color monitor >= 14"  suitable for use on a Macintosh
Centris 610.  I am planning on purchasing one of these machines
soon and don't want to have to pay full price for a new monitor
when a used one will do me just as well.  If you have one you'd
like to part with, please email me with the specs and price.

Thanks.
