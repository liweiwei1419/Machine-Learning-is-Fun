Subject: Countersteering sans Hands

So how do I steer when my hands aren't on the bars? (Open Budweiser in left 
hand, Camel cigarette in the right, no feet allowed.) If I lean, and the 
bike turns, am I countersteering? Is countersteering like benchracing only 
with a taller seat, so your feet aren't on the floor?
