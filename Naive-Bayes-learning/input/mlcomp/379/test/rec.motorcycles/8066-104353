Subject: Info on Sport-Cruisers

I'm looking for a sport-cruiser - factory installed fairings (
full/half ), hard saddle bags, 750cc and above, and all that and still
has that sporty look.

I particularly like the R100RS and K75 RT or S, or any of the K series
BMW bikes.

I was wondering if there are any other comparable type bikes being
produced by companies other than BMW.

Thanks for the info,
Jae
