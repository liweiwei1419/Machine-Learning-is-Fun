Subject: stats for hockey pool

I'm the keeper of the stats for a family hockey pool and I'm looking
for daily/weekly email servers for playoff stats.  I've connected with
the servers at J.Militzok@skidmore.EDU and wilson@cs.ucf.edu.  I'm
still sorting these two out.

Are there others?  Email please as my site doesn't get this group.

Thanks.

Rick
