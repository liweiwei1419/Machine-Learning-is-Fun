Subject: Who will be #1 pick in NHL draft?

I recently bought a pack of prospect hockey cards which had various
players that were coming into the NHL. I got this particular card of
a Russian named Viktor Kozlov. It says "many scouts believe he will
be the #1 pick in 1993". Another guy is quoted as saying "He's as 
good as Mario Lemieux". Anyone know who this guy is?????
