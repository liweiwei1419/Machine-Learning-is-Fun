Subject: Re: DAVID CORESH IS! GOD!

On one of the morning shows (I think is was the Today Show), David Koresh's
lawyer was interviewed. During that interview he flipped through some letters
that David Koresh wrote. On one of letters was written in Hebrew (near the
bottom of the page):

  koresh adonai

Did anyone else see that? What could this mean by him (David) writing this?
