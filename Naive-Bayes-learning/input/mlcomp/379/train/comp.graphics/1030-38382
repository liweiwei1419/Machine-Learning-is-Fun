Subject: PD 3D Viewer wanted
From: qiaok@bones.et.byu.edu (Kun Qiao)

I am looking for a public domain 3d viewer.  It does not have to be very
fancy.  The features I want is simple wireframe display, flat shading, 
simple transformation.  It would be nice to have hidden line.    

Any information is appreciated.
