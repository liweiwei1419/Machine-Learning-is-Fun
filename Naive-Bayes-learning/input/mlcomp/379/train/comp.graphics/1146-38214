Subject: MPEG for x-windows MONO needed.

Hello, and thank you for reading this request.  I have a Mpeg viewer for x-windows and it did not run because I was running it on a monochrome monitor.  I need the mono-driver for mpeg_play.   

Please post the location of the file or better yet, e-mail me at mlee@eng.sdsu.edu.
