Subject: Easy to translate JPEG code...

Does anyone out there have any JPEG decompression code in pretty much any
language that I can read and understand?  I have trouble understanding the
JPEG Group's code that I got from an FTP site.  If any one can send me
some good code, I will appreciate it a lot!  Thanks!
