Subject: LOOKING for CTDS !

I can't find CTDS (Connect The Dots Smoother) in France. If it is a commercial
program I'll happily pay whatever it may cost (do not take it litterally).
Please help!
I have *LOTS* of PoV sources, texture images and animations though, if you
are looking for something, just tell.
