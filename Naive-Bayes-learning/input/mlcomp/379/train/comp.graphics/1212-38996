Subject: Picture -> Ascii Conversion?

I was wondering if anyone has ever seen/heard of a utility that converts
any type of image format (gif,tiff,pcx,bmp,jpeg,etc.) to an ascii
representation.  I have seen some very sophiticated art in ascii format, but
never was I able to find the author or any program that may have converted
the data from a picture format.

Any help or leads would be great. Thanks in advance.
