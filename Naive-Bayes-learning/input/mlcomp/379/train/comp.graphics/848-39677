Subject: NEEDED: non-interactive GIF cropper for PC


   I have a group of GIF images that each contain 6 small images in 
the same place on all the images. I need a program to crop out the
small images to a new GIF file. All the programs I can find make me
use the mouse or keyboard to define the cropping coordinates. Is there
a program out there for a PC that can take the crop coordinates on
the command line?
