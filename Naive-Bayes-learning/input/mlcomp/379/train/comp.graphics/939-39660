Subject: Oriented bounding box generation?

       I'm looking for code that will generate a minimum-volume oriented
bounding box for an arbitrary polyhedron.  Anyone know of such code?

       Why?  I'm converting objects from
one modelling system into another, and the destination system is object
oriented.  So I want to represent each object in its own coordinate system,
that of its bounding box, with the objects then translated and rotated
appropriately, this being the representation used in the destination
system.
