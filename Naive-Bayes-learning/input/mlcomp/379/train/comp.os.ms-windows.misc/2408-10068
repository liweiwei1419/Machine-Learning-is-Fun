Subject:      Changing system font

Hello.
      I have Windows 3.1 and I was wondering what is necessary to change the
default system font to something else.  I have just obtained MSC/C++ 7.0 with
SDK, so I'd really like to get my feet wet with doing my first windows pro-
gram to change the system font.

Tx.,
