Subject: Help Wanted Loading Logitech Scanman Driver in High memory

I am having troubleloading my Logitech Scanman Driver (latest version) into
high memory with the devicehigh command in MSDOS 6. It gives me an
'invalid parameters' message. Is it necessary to change some of the scanner
driver parameters when loading high?
Any help would be appreciated
