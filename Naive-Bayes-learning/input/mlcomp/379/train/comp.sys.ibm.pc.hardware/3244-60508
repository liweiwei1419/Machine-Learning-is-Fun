Subject: Need Info on font cartridge for HP LaserJet II

I am looking for good add-on font cartridge for HP LaserJet II.
I found in PC Magazine article IQ Enginnering and Pacific Data Products
are well-known maker of cartridge for HP LaserJet series. But I couldn't find
the model name of these products.

Any suggestions please.

Thanks in advance,
