Subject: Comments on an accelerated Video Card for ISA bus

Hi,
  I am looking to buy an accelerated video card for my 486 DX 50 with	
ISA bus.  I have a 14" SVGA NI monitor.  I'm currently running
DOS 5.0 and windows 3.1, although I'm considering OS/2 in the	
future.  Can anyone make a suggestion for a video card that would
suit my needs?  How is Diamond speedstar? Stealth? Etc....
				Thanks.
