Subject: Need help installing a simms in 700, quick!

Could someone please send instructions for installing simms and vram to 
jmk13@po.cwru.edu?  He's just gotten his 700 and wants to drop in some 
extra simms and vram that he has for it.

Thanks... and don't reply to me, reply to jmk13@po.cwru.edu (Joe)
