Hi Mac fans,

I have some problems with my new Quadra 700. Several programs
(Mathematica 2.1, AfterDark-Mandelbrot module) causes a systemcrash
if the 040Cache is active. Do anyone have a list of programs which
are compatible and which are not? Do anyone have some hints for the 
use of the Quadras perfomence?

Thanks Joerg
