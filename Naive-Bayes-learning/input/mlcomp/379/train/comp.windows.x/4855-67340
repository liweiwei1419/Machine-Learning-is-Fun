Subject: Using message passing with XtAddInput 

In the past, I have used named pipes to communicate between processes using
the XtAddInput function to set up the event handling in Motif. Does anybody
know of a way to do this with message passing ( IPC ) ? I tried it here and
no luck so far.

Thanks
