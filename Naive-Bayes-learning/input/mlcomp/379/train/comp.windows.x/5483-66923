Subject: Looking for Xt and Xaw

I want to compile Xdvi and later perhaps Emacs 19 on a DEC Ultrix machine with
X installed. Unfortunately, Xt and Xaw libs and headers are missing. How can I
get them without having to compile the whole MIT distribution ? 

Pleasy reply by email to: viola@yukawa.uni-muenster.de

Thanks in advance.
