Subject: Wcl for Solaris 2?

Is there a version of Wcl that has been ported to Solaris 2, including
ANSI C? I had numerous problems trying to compile Wcl under Solaris, 
and the functions do not have prototypes.  

I have Wcl 2.01 from the Sun User Group's 1992 CDs.

Please email answers as I am not on this list.
