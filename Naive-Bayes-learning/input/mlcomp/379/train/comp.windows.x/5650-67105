Subject: WANTED: Info on Dedicated X Server Kernel for Sun3/100 Series

If anyone has any information about the existence or location of a
dedicated X server kernel for the Sun3, please send email.  I am
trying to put some neglected Sun3s to good use but they don't have
enough memory for SunOS 4.1.1.  Thanks in advance for any help.
