Subject: LAW & ORDER & DoD

Anyone catch the TV show Law & Order last night (at least here in
NYC)?  They "the law enforcement people", needed to catch a member of
DoD (Department of Doom) for inflicting a computer virus in a
hospital's mainframe which ended up killing two people because wrong
amounts of medication were given to them.

Anyhow, is "Department of Doom" on the list?
