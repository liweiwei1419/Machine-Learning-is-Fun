Subject: Why didn't they come out?

After the initial gun battle was over, they had 50 days to come out
peacefully. They had their high priced lawyer, and judging by the
posts here they had some public support. Can anyone come up
with a rational explanation why the didn't come out (even after
they negotiated coming out after the radio sermon) that doesn't
include the Davidians wanting to commit suicide/murder/general mayhem?
